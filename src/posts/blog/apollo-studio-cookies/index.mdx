During the development of LendLab, I found myself wrestling with a stubborn cookie error over several days while attempting to implement user authentication.

At first glance, everything seemed to be in order within both the source code and the Apollo Studio configuration. The CORS system was correctly set up, including the URL for studio.apollographql.

```ts
const main = async () => {
  const app = express();

  const RedisStore = connectRedis(session);
  const client = new Redis();

  app.use(
    cors({
      credentials: true,
      origin: ["https://studio.apollographql.com", "http://localhost:3000"],
    })
  );

  app.use(
    session({
      name: "qid",
      store: new RedisStore({ client, disableTouch: true }),
      cookie: {
        httpOnly: true,
        maxAge: 100 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000,
      },
      saveUninitialized: false,
      secret: "oiteroietrioweuiowqhwqhsdhjksndfnsd",
      resave: false,
    })
  );

  const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({
    schema: await buildSchema({
      validate: false,
      resolvers: [__dirname + "/resolver/**/*.js"],
    }),
    context: ({ req, res }): Context => ({ req, res }),
  });

  await apolloServer.start();

  apolloServer.applyMiddleware({
    app,
    path: "/",
    cors: false,
  });

  app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log("listening on port " + 4000);
  });
};

main();
```

To tackle this issue, I made the decision to migrate the project to version 2 of the Apollo Server, which boasts GraphQL Playground instead of the Apollo Sandbox/Studio introduced in the following version. I enabled cookies in the configuration, and, as if by magic, authentication began working without a single line of code being altered. From this, I deduced that the culprit was Apollo Studio. However, I was not willing to give it up, as its user interface and experience were superior in every aspect.

Thankfully, after days of scouring various forums, I finally found a solution that I'm eager to share with you.


## Firstly

Firstly, cookies must be included on Apollo Studio's configuration, otherwise cookies will not be saved, as it's __desactivated for default__.

In the same configuration section, it is specified that the cookie should contain the following attributes:

- SameSite "None"
- Secure

Therefore, we'll add these features to our code.

```typescript
app.use(
  session({
    name: "qid",
    store: new RedisStore({ client, disableTouch: true }),
    cookie: {
      httpOnly: true,
      // highlight-start
      sameSite: "none",
      secure: true,
      // highlight-end
      maxAge: 100 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000,
    },
    saveUninitialized: false,
    secret: "oiteroietrioweuiowqhwqhsdhjksndfnsd",
    resave: false,
  })
);
```

## What's Next?

We're about to end. In the same configuration that we opened earlier in Apollo Studio, we'll add a new `default header` called `x-forwarded proton`.

  caption="x-forwarded-proto added in default headers"
/>

Lastly, all that remains is to add the following line of code at the start of ours.

```typescript
app.set("trust proxy", true);
```

That's how I managed to overcome an issue that kept me on tenterhooks for days. I hope this solution might help you if you find yourself in a similar situation. Keep going and happy coding!
