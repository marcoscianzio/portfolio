During the development of Lendlab i faced for several days a problem while trying to implement the authentication of users.

At first sight everything seemed fine, neither the code or the apollo configuration  was certainly incorrect. The cors was correctly implemented, including the URL of studio.apollographql.

```ts
const main = async () => {
  const app = express();

  const RedisStore = connectRedis(session);
  const client = new Redis();

  app.use(
    cors({
      credentials: true,
      origin: ["https://studio.apollographql.com", "http://localhost:3000"],
    })
  );

  app.use(
    session({
      name: "qid",
      store: new RedisStore({ client, disableTouch: true }),
      cookie: {
        httpOnly: true,
        maxAge: 100 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000,
      },
      saveUninitialized: false,
      secret: "oiteroietrioweuiowqhwqhsdhjksndfnsd",
      resave: false,
    })
  );

  const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({
    schema: await buildSchema({
      validate: false,
      resolvers: [__dirname + "/resolver/**/*.js"],
    }),
    context: ({ req, res }): Context => ({ req, res }),
  });

  await apolloServer.start();

  apolloServer.applyMiddleware({
    app,
    path: "/",
    cors: false,
  });

  app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log("listening on port " + 4000);
  });
};

main();
```

Trying to resolve this problem i decided to migrate the project to Apollo Server version 2, which used GraphQL Playground instead of Apollo Sandbox/Studio introduced in the following release. 

I activated the cookies and then, magically, without changing a single line of code, the authentication started working as expected. Therefore, i concluded that was definitely something wrong with Apollo Studio, but i denied myself from stop using it, as in terms of UI & UX is thousands of times better.

Fortunately, after a long period of search, i was finally capable of coming to a solution and that why i am here with you today.


## Firstly

Firstly, cookies must be included on Apollo Studio's configuration, otherwise cookies will not be saved, as it's __desactivated for default__.

In the same place, we're told that the cookie must contain:

- SameSite "None"
- Secure

So, let's add it.

```typescript
app.use(
  session({
    name: "qid",
    store: new RedisStore({ client, disableTouch: true }),
    cookie: {
      httpOnly: true,
      // highlight-start
      sameSite: "none",
      secure: true,
      // highlight-end
      maxAge: 100 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000,
    },
    saveUninitialized: false,
    secret: "oiteroietrioweuiowqhwqhsdhjksndfnsd",
    resave: false,
  })
);
```

## Ok, and now what?

We're about to end. In the configuration that we opened previously, we must add a new `default header` caññed x-forwarded proton.

  caption="x-forwarded-proto added in default headers"
/>

Lastly, we just need to add the following line of code.

```typescript
app.set("trust proxy", true);
```
