Once i tried `Chakra`, i couldn't go back. Perhaps the reason behind this preference relays on the fact i'm a bit lazy when it comes to stylizing components, especially when making design systems. However, there is a huge truth: `Chakra UI` is amazing.

Probable similarly to other developers, i felt myself very comfortable just using css at the very beginning, without recurring to any framework or library.

Eventually, i gave `Bootstrap` a try. That experience highlighted the no need to create a bunch of .css files, and for those less imaginative, thinking about class names.

However, there was a huge problem. Everything looked so generic. Therefore, i went back to plain CSS as Styled Components really didn't caught my attention.

Unforeseen, while i was watching a video on Youtube, i discovered Chakra. The idea of styling a component by simply passing props to it amazed me.

```jsx
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/react";

<Box bg="red.400" py={12} px={4} borderWidth={1} borderColor="green.400" />;
```

This, as you can expect, improved my speed on styling components. In fact, it changed my mood, i was frankly way more excited to start new projects.

## Yeah that's great, but how i'm supposed to make a hover?

That's one of the questions that came into my main as i was learning Chakra. Fortunately, it couldn't be more simpler.

So, let's just imagine we want to change the height of a box on hover.

```jsx
import { Box } from "@chakra-ui/react";

<Box
  h={12}
  transition="all 0.2s"
  _hover={{
    h: 96,
  }}
/>;
```

As you can appreciate, it's only neccesary to pass an object to `_hover` with the new styles.

Okay, that's looks great. But let's see another case. We want to make a children box increase its padding when hovering it's parent element. This could be done by using `_groupHover`

```jsx
import { Box, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react";

<Box
  _groupHover={{
    p: 4,
  }}
  transition="all 0.2s"
  p={8}
>
  <Box>
    <Text>Hello World!</Text>
  </Box>
</Box>;
```
