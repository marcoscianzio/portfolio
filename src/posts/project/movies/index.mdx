Most movie-related applications tend to leverage the The Movie Database (TMDB) API. However, on this occasion, I decided to take the road less traveled and embark on the adventure of creating my own movie API from scratch.

The goal was not simply to be able to query movies. I wanted to go further and incorporate features that would also allow the search of a movie's cast and genres. Not only that, but I also desired to include the ability to search for specific actors and the movies they've starred in. Furthermore, I deemed it important for the API to be capable of a reverse lookup, that is, to be able to query the movies an actor has participated in.

In its current state, the API already has the necessary mutations to create all the aforementioned entities. However, my vision goes further. In the future, I plan to transform this application into a comprehensive dashboard for managing movie, actor, and genre data. This way, we could not only consult information but also actively interact with it, creating a much more dynamic and interesting experience.
