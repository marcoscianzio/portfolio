In the 21st century, technology is an integral part of our daily lives. However, many tasks are still carried out manually, such as administrative tasks. This is particularly true for universities that must manage a large number of certificates, each one with its individual data. These data have to be entered by the back office staff and then stored on paper forms which are subsequently sent to students. This procedure, although classic, commonly generates considerable costs of management, wastes time for those who want to receive their documents quickly, and is prone to human mistakes. It would appear that there is a need for an automatization tool that ensures an efficient administration. Therefore, the aim of this project is to create a desktop application to solve this issue, driven by the recent interest of the Technological University of Uruguay. In addition, requirements were gathered from various secretaries in order to create a system that would satisfy their needs. Lastly, there is a wide range of expectations from this project, but the core stays the same: leave behind the work by hand to the click work.
