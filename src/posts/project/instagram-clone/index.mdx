Instagram provides a unique platform for photo-sharing, allowing our followers to view, comment on, and "like" them.

During my exploration of Instagram clones, I noticed a recurring shortfall: the absence of the original's two-tiered commenting feature. This observation sparked my curiosity and posed a challenge to replicate such a functionality. Therefore, I embarked on the task of implementing it.

However, I didn't merely want to clone Instagram's user interface. Instead, I opted to give it a twist, adopting a more modern and refreshing design.

This project is a work in progress. I plan to continue enriching it with more features found in Instagram, such as stories, and furthermore, I aspire to innovate by adding new features, like the ability to share music. In summary, I'm committed to the ongoing enhancement and expansion of this project to keep it relevant and exciting.
