Instagram is a free photo and video sharing app. People can upload photos to the service and share them with their followers or with a select group of friends.

I realised most Instagram clones lacked from the original comment section which is 2 level deep. Therefore, i wondered how could i recreate that, and eventually, decided to try implement the functionality. Furthermore, i didn't exactly clone instagram's ui, i gave it a more modern look instead.

I'm looking forward to continue improving this project in the future, by adding more instagram's functionalities like stories, and even creating new ones such as sharing music.
