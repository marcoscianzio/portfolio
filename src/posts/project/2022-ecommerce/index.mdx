Back in 2020, during my early days as a programmer, I worked on a Java application, specifically building an e-commerce platform. Now, after two years, my skills and understanding of programming have significantly matured, but I had yet to apply this experience in a web development environment.

While we were developing Lend Lab, my colleague and I engaged in several discussions about incorporating online payments through Stripe, a concept that was completely novel to us. Unfortunately, support for Lend Lab came to a halt, but the idea of integrating online payments remained etched in my mind.

In conclusion, I sought to challenge myself by putting my knowledge of TypeORM to the test once again.

Essentially, the application consists of a robust authentication module that allows users to log in using their Github accounts. Once authenticated, users can add products to their shopping cart. Each time an item is added to the cart, the total price dynamically adjusts, reflecting the updated value.

Within the cart, users have the flexibility to modify individual item quantities, either by increasing or decreasing them. Once the user has decided to finalize their purchase, the process redirects to Stripe's billing service to securely and efficiently complete the transaction.

Subsequently, users have the ability to access a comprehensive billing history, where they can review all invoices generated throughout their experience in the application. This functionality enables users to maintain a detailed record of items acquired in each transaction.
