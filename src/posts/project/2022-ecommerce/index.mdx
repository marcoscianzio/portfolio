I had previously worked on a Java Application Ecommerce around 2020. After 2 years, my knowledge have improved a lot, and i had not made this kind of application on a web development environment.

During the development of Lend Lab, Nicol√°s and me were discussing about the idea of integrating online payments with Stripe, which was something completely new for us. Unfortunately, Lend Lab was no longer mantained, but the previously mentioned idea kept in my mind.

In addition, i wanted to put my TypeORM knowledge in practice once more.
