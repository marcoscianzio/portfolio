In recent times, the educational system has been incorporating a series of technological advances aimed to improve the control of information circulating in this type of academic centers. To cite an example, the new system to pass class attendance. As a consequence of the health conditions in 2020 and 2021, a lot of courses have turned into virtual learning environments, for instance, the Crea platform.

In this case, the management of equipment and lends is a daily task of significant relevance at schools, which falls on the responsibility of the teacher, as well as on the commitment of the students. In contrast, this has affected considerably and put at risk its basic organization, being used a book to keep the information.

For this reason, we were told in college to solve this problem, developing a web application where teachers can manage all kind of lends, providing comfort, efficiency, speed and agile control to it, ending such an outdated "book and pen" system. In addition, our program solves the issue of the students who try to steal something that they receive as a lend.

An application was developed aimed at efficiently managing loaning of supplies in educational institutions. This solution supports two main user profiles: students and lab technicians. Students have the ability to request loans for various supplies, such as chargers and other items. In parallel, lab technicians, who play a crucial role, receive these requests in real-time, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding approval or rejection. A prominent feature of the application is an intuitive dashboard designed exclusively for lab technicians. This dashboard provides them with comprehensive control over the inventory of materials, as well as a detailed tracking of interactions with students. It's worth highlighting that this functionality is restricted to the educational institution to which each lab technician belongs, ensuring privacy and effective resource management.On the other hand, students enjoy the convenience of accessing a complete record of their previous reservations and loans. This functionality offers relevant and detailed information about their interactions with the application, allowing them to maintain proper control over their resources.

Finally, **it was my first time using TypeORM, TypeGraphQL and Apollo GraphQL**. Furthermore, the app was deployed and in production for about a month until my teammate decided to take it down as his Digital Ocean free plas was finish.
