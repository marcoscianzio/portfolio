In recent times, the educational system has been incorporating a series of technological advances aimed to improve the control of information circulating in this type of academic centers. To cite an example, the new system to pass class attendance. As a consequence of the health conditions in 2020 and 2021, a lot of courses have turned into virtual learning environments, for instance, the Crea platform.

In this case, the management of equipment and lends is a daily task of significant relevance at schools, which falls on the responsibility of the teacher, as well as on the commitment of the students. In contrast, this has affected considerably and put at risk its basic organization, being used a book to keep the information.

For this reason, we were told in college to solve this problem, developing a web application where teachers can manage all kind of lends, providing comfort, efficiency, speed and agile control to it, ending such an outdated "book and pen" system. In addition, our program solves the issue of the students who try to steal something that they receive as a lend.

To sum up, the app was created to **manage the lends in educational institutions**. As an example, when a computer is needed to do a student’s homework, he will choose to use the website to request the material, and then the teacher will also be able to decide whether to accept or reject this one.

Finally, **it was my first time using TypeORM, TypeGraphQL and Apollo GraphQL**. Furthermore, the app was deployed and in production for about a month until Nicolás decided to take it down as his Digital Ocean free plas was finish.
