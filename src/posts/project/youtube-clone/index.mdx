YouTube stands as a robust digital platform that allows users to upload videos and share them with a global audience instantaneously and online.

The prospect of mimicking YouTube's video upload functionality caught my interest due to its inherent complexity and growth opportunity it presented. I decided to embark on the journey of crafting a clone of this popular platform with the aim of enhancing and challenging my technical skills.

Previously, I had the chance to work with Cloudinary on several projects, utilizing its efficient image management. However, its potential for handling videos was uncharted territory for me. This intrigued me and pushed me to explore this functionality, thereby expanding my mastery and understanding of this valuable tool.

This challenge not only allowed me to familiarize myself with Cloudinary's video management but also understand the intricate details that lie behind the simple act of uploading a video to an online platform like YouTube. Undoubtedly, this experience has enriched my skillset and broadened my vision of programming and web development.
