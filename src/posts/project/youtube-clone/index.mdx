YouTube is a free video sharing website that makes it easy to watch online videos. You can even create and upload your own videos to share with others.

The video upload seemed an interesting challenge, so I decided to create a clone of this app. I had previously used Cloudinary for the upload of images, and had no idea of ​​that you can actually do the same with videos.
